      "body": "Columbidae  is a bird family consisting of pigeons and doves. It is the only family in the order Columbiformes. These are stout-bodied birds with short necks, and short slender bills that in some species feature fleshy ceres. They primarily feed on seeds, fruits, and plants. The family occurs worldwide, but the greatest variety is in the Indomalayan and Australasian realms.\n\nThe family contains 344 species divided into 50 genera. Thirteen of the species are extinct.[2]\n\nIn English, the smaller species tend to be called \"doves\" and the larger ones \"pigeons\".[3] However, the distinction is not consistent,[3] and does not exist in most other languages. Historically, the common names for these birds involve a great deal of variation between the terms. The bird most commonly referred to as just \"pigeon\" is the domestic pigeon, which is common in many cities as the feral pigeon.\n\nPigeon is a French word that derives from the Latin pipio, for a \"peeping\" chick,[4] while dove is an ultimately Germanic word that refers to the bird's diving flight.[5] The English dialectal word culver appears to derive from Latin columba.[4] A group of doves is called a \"dule\", taken from the French word deuil ('mourning').",

      "body": "The Civil War in the United States began in 1861, after decades of simmering tensions between northern and southern states over slavery, states’ rights and westward expansion. The election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 caused seven southern states to secede and form the Confederate States of America; four more states soon joined them. The War Between the States, as the Civil War was also known, ended in Confederate surrender in 1865. The conflict was the costliest and deadliest war ever fought on American soil, with some 620,000 of 2.4 million soldiers killed, millions more injured and much of the South left in ruin.",

      "title": "Habits of Effective People",
      "body": "Efficient people are well organized and competent. They check things off their to-do list. They complete projects. They get stuff done.\n\nEffective people do all that ... but they check the right things off their to-do list. They complete the right projects. They get the right stuff done.\n\nThey execute and produce what makes the biggest difference for their business ... and for themselves.\n\nHere are some of the traits of remarkably effective people, and why they're so successful:\n\n1. They always start with goals.\nEffort without a genuine purpose is just effort. Effective people don't just know what to do--they know why. They have a long-term goal. They have short-term goals that support their long-term goals.\n\nIn short, they have purpose--and that purpose informs everything they do. That's why remarkable people appear so dedicated and organized and consistently on-task. They're not slaves to a routine; they're simply driven to reach their goals and quick to eliminate roadblocks and put aside distractions that stand in their way.\n\nRemarkably effective people set their goals first. So decide what success means to you. (Your definition of success is and should be different from everyone else's.)\n\nYou'll find it's easy to stay focused and be effective when you truly care about what you hope to achieve.\n\nEven so, once they establish a goal, remarkably effective people don't focus solely on that goal; instead ... \n\n2. Then they create systems.\nIf you're an entrepreneur, your goal is to build a successful business. Your system consists of your processes for sales, marketing, fulfillment, operations, etc.\n\nA goal is great for planning and mapping out what success looks like; a system is great for actually making progress toward that goal.\n\nRemarkably effective people know a goal can provide direction and even push them forward in the short term, but eventually a well-designed system will always win.\n\nEveryone has goals; committing to a system makes all the difference in achieving that goal.\n\n3. They believe in themselves.\nDiligence isn't easy. Hard work is hard. Pushing forward when successes are few and far between takes optimism and self-belief.\n\nThat's why busy people quickly give up and effective people keep going.\n\nRemarkably effective people embrace the fact (and it is a fact) that the only way to get to where they want to go is to try ... and keep on trying. They know that eventually they will succeed, because ...\n\n4. They believe they are in control of their lives.\nMany people feel luck--or outside forces--has a lot to do with success or failure. If they succeed, luck favored them; if they fail, luck was against them.\n\nLuck certainly does play a part, but effective people don't hope for good luck or worry about bad luck. They assume success is totally within their control. If they succeed, they caused it; if they fail, they caused that, too.\n\nRemarkably effective people waste zero mental energy worrying about what might happen to them--they put all their effort into making things happen.\n\nThey know they can never control luck ... but they can always control themselves.\n\n5. And yet they also embrace \"random.\"\nWhen your nose is to the grindstone, all you can see is the grindstone. And that means you miss opportunities to spot something new, try something different, or go off on a fruitful tangent.\n\nEffective people stay almost totally on-task. Remarkably effective people build in time and opportunity to experience new things, try new methods, and benefit from happy accidents.\n\nThey're not always trying to reinvent the wheel. But they're more than happy to adopt someone else's perfectly functioning wheel.\n\n6. They find happiness in the success of others.\nGreat teams win because their most talented members are willing to sacrifice to help others succeed.\n\nThat's why great companies are made up of employees who help each other, know their roles, set aside their personal goals, and value team success over everything else.\n\nWhere does that attitude come from?\n\nYou.\n\nFocus only on yourself and ultimately you'll be by yourself. To be remarkably effective, find fulfillment in helping other people succeed. In the process you will succeed, too--in more ways than one.\n\n7. They use their goals to make decisions automatic.\nIn a podcast, Tim Ferriss described how Herb Kelleher, the CEO of Southwest Airlines, makes so many decisions every day. Kelleher applies a simple framework to every issue: Will this help Southwest be the low-cost provider? If so, the answer is yes. If not, no.\n\nRemarkably effective people apply the same framework to the decisions they make. \"Will this help me reach my goal? If not, I won't do it.\"\n\nIf you feel like you're constantly struggling to make decisions, take a step back. Think about your goals; your goals will help you make decisions.\n\nThat's why remarkably effective people are so decisive. Indecision is born of a lack of purpose: When you know what you truly want, most of your decisions can--and should--be almost automatic.\n\n8. They don't multitask.\nPlenty of research says multitasking doesn't work. (Some research says multitasking actually makes you stupid.)\n\nMaybe you don't agree.\n\nMaybe you're wrong. Try to do two things at once and you'll do both half-assed.\n\nRemarkably effective people focus on one thing at a time. They do that one thing incredibly well ... and then they move on to whatever is next. And they do that incredibly well.\n\n9. They freely ask for help.\nBusy people ask for help getting something done. Remarkably effective people ask for help not just because they need help but also because by asking they show respect for the other person and trust his or her experience, skill, or insight.\n\nMutual respect is the foundation of every solid relationship--and the best way to create mutual respect is to first show respect.\n\nWant to be remarkably effective? Surround yourself with people who trust and motivate and inspire you--and in turn are inspired by you.\n\nEven if you don't achieve all your goals, your life will be infinitely richer.",

      "title": "Confidence vs Self Esteem",
      "body": "What’s the difference between self-confidence and self-esteem? Self-confidence is how confident you are in your ability or skills. Self-esteem relates to how you feel about yourself. It is possible to have self-confidence and at the same time, have low self-esteem. There is a huge difference between the two.\n/n\n<h2>Self-Confidence</h2>\nSelf-confidence is how you project yourself to other people. An expert golfer may feel very confident in their ability to play golf. Golf is a skill they have acquired through practice. You can build confidence through a skill set. You can develop confidence further through practice and accomplishments others see. Confidence is something you feel inside. Something other people notice in you.\n\nBut even if you have confidence in your skills, you may not feel self-confident. People might tell you how well you are performing, while you still lack confidence in your skills. Confidence shows up as skills, developed and demonstrated to the world.\n\nSelf-Esteem\nSelf-esteem is how you see yourself on the inside, and is invisible to the outside world. When people think they see self-esteem in another, they are actually seeing self-confidence. Self-esteem is on the inside. It doesn’t come from skills. Self-esteem results from who you are.\n\nSelf-esteem results when you believe in your inherent goodness. This may seem to be a radical concept for people with ADHD. The concept is that we are brought into this world, and we are made of love. Love is often described as the highest feeling there is. If you want to feel self-esteem, you must feel love and love for yourself. You need to take the feeling of love you have for others – such as for your spouse, a baby, for playing an instrument, for reading – and pull that feeling inside to feel that love for yourself.",
